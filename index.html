<h2> Who is Rory Gallagher? </h2>

<div class="paragraphDiv" id="pD1">
<p>Rory Gallagher is an Irish-Born guitarist famous for his incredibly energetic performances and his extraordinary studio work. He has produced many albums over the years, but has never strayed from live performances. He has created music in the form of many different genres, including blues, blues-rock, jazz, and folk. As a kid, he was enamored with the workings of guitarists such as Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraphDiv">
<p>He obtained his famous guitar, a worn 1961 sunburst Stratocaster, in August 1963. His family, nowhere near wealthy, would pay it off for years. This gave Rory an interdependent relationship with his guitar, as he needed it to play shows in order to pay for it. He kept this guitar and used it extensively throughout his career. One defining characteristic of the guitar, its worn-down, beat-up appearance, arose from his highly alkaline sweat which accumulated on it during his shows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraphDiv">
<p>His passionate and unassuming nature would prove to stand out in his music, producing an abundance of albums over his career. He never cared for fame and fortune, and simply desired to create music that reflected his raw energy in addition to his deep thoughtfullness. Songs such as "I Fall apart" exemplify this deep musicality embedded in his soul, while others such as "Bad Penny"(seen on the left) reflect the raw energy of his persona. As his career went on, he would produce innumerable successes until sadly, in 1995, he would die of liver cancer at the age of 45.</p>
